# 🏃 Marathon Log: 2026-02-18

Today was a significant day for Orbiter, focusing on segment expansion, operational transparency, and remote command capability. We moved the system from a "black box" to a fully transparent, remotely controllable trading engine.

## 🏁 Milestones Achieved

### 1. MCX Segment Finalization
- **Mapping:** Completed full futures token mapping for MCX commodities (CRUDEOIL, GOLD, etc.).
- **Lot Sizes:** Implemented priority-based lot size resolution (Live WS -> Cache -> Master).
- **Automation:** Automated config generation via `update_mcx_config.py`.

### 2. Automated Session Summaries (v3.2.0)
- **Pre-Session:** Automated fund/margin/position checks at 9:30 AM (NFO) and 5:30 PM (MCX).
- **Post-Session:** Comprehensive P&L and estimated T+1 margin reports at market close.
- **Tax Estimation:** Built a `TaxCalculator` to provide "Net P&L" by accounting for brokerage, STT, and GST.

### 3. Telegram Command & Control (C2) (v3.3.0 - v3.4.0)
- **Listener:** Implemented an asynchronous background thread to process incoming Telegram messages.
- **Commands:** 
    - `/status`: Deep-dive into financial health and operational state.
    - `/margin`: Quick snapshot of buying power.
    - `/scan`: Real-time market pulse (Top 10 movers) and position P&L.
    - `/help`: Detailed user guide delivered inside the chat.
- **Safety:** Secured `/cleanup` with session-activity blocks and a 60-second confirmation window.

### 4. DevOps & Integrity Fixes
- **Check-Sums:** Fixed 3482+ integrity failures by switching to relative paths and excluding volatile runtime files.
- **Versioning:** Established a rigorous versioning strategy:
    - **Major (X.0.0):** Complete makeover.
    - **Minor (0.X.0):** New roadmap feature.
    - **Patch (0.0.X):** Every push/fix.
- **Deployment:** Verified 100% synchronization and service stability on Raspberry Pi.

## 🛠️ Technical Debt Resolved
- Excluded `python-trader` submodules from integrity checks.
- Normalized line endings across macOS and Linux environments.
- Deprecated legacy `core/client.py` in favor of modular `core/broker/`.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Mass filter analysis for 1% NIFTY movers.
- Implementation of the `RuntimeConfig` manager for hot-reloading filter weights.
- Refinement of the Orbitron shaded drawdown graph in Sniper reports.
